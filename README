Setup:

In order to build the firmware, the Zephyr development environment
needs to be set up. This includes both the Zephyr SDK and the Zephyr
source tree. The source tree is shipped as a git submodule inside the
ext directory of the repository root. Refer to the Zephyr getting
started guide[1] for detailed instructions on setting up the SDK.

A script for setting up the required environment variables is provided.
The script assumes the default Zephyr SDK install location and it should
be run from the repository root.

$ source scripts/env-setup.sh

Flashing the firmware requires SEGGER J-Link utilites. Refer to the
nRF52-PCA10040 Zephyr documentation[2] for further details.

Building:

The firmware is built the same way as any other Zephyr project:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DBOARD=nrf52_pca10040 ..
$ make
$ make flash
