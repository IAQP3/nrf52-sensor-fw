Setup:

In order to build the firmware, the Zephyr development environment
needs to be set up. This includes both the Zephyr SDK and the Zephyr
source tree. Refer to the Zephyr getting started guide[1] for
detailed instructions.

Flashing the firmware requires SEGGER J-Link utilites. Refer to the
nRF52-PCA10040 Zephyr documentation[2] for further details.

Building:

The firmware is build the same way as any other Zephyr project:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DBOARD=nrf52_pca10040 ..
$ make
$ make flash
